## 3. Description of the Challenge
During migration or humanitarian crises, AOZ must rapidly coordinate the procurement and management of essential goods such as beds, blankets, hygiene items, and furniture.  
Currently, different departments (e.g., Zivilschutz, Sozialdepartement, Tiefbauamt) handle these supplies separately, leading to duplication, inefficient storage, and limited transparency.

The challenge is to design a **centralized digital system** that improves coordination, enables joint procurement, monitors stock and availability in real time, and ensures faster response and resource allocation during emergencies.
