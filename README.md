## 3. Description of the Challenge
During migration or humanitarian crises, AOZ must rapidly coordinate the procurement and management of essential goods such as beds, blankets, hygiene items, and furniture.  
Currently, different departments (e.g., Zivilschutz, Sozialdepartement, Tiefbauamt) handle these supplies separately, leading to duplication, inefficient storage, and limited transparency.

The challenge is to design a **centralized digital system** that improves coordination, enables joint procurement, monitors stock and availability in real time, and ensures faster response and resource allocation during emergencies.

## 4. Solution Overview
** WORK IN PROGRESS **
*(To be completed after development — include screenshots, workflow, and demo link here)*

CrisisCore is designed with different use cases in mind. In crisis management, an intuitive UI and well thought through workflows are key. The following main user flows were identified:
- A member of the crisis management team ("Kriesenstab" in German) requires some amout of a certain resource (for example beds or towels)
- A member of the maintanance team wants to look up the stocks at a certain location
- A crisis management team lead requires to fastely handle access permissions to the platform

The above workflows resulted in the different UI's explained further below.
